BTF (BiTmap Flip)

a custom image file (.btf) that porpose is to be lightweight than .bmp file
(also need a program to view file)

the file has 1-bit color for each pixel, so single bytes can hold 8 pixels!

downside is:
	it only has 1-bit color, so just use PNG or JPEG for compatiblity and more color
	and nobody going know what is .btf file
