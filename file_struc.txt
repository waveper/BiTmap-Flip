File Structure (.btf)

Overview
- Custom 1-bit-per-pixel bitmap format.
- All multi-byte integers are big-endian (most significant byte first).
- Pixels are packed 8 per byte, most-significant bit first.

Header (7 bytes total)
- Signature: 3 bytes
  - 0x42 0x54 0x46 (ASCII "BTF")
  - If signature is missing or incorrect, the viewer should error.
- Width: 2 bytes (unsigned)
- Height: 2 bytes (unsigned)

Pixel Data
- Size: width * height bits.
- Storage: packed into bytes, 8 pixels per byte.
- Bit order: MSB first (left-most pixel of each 8-pixel group is bit 7).
- Padding: if width * height is not a multiple of 8, the last byte is padded with 0 bits in the least-significant positions.

Example (Hex)
42 54 46 00 01 00 01 80

Breakdown
- 42 54 46  -> "BTF" signature
- 00 01     -> width = 1
- 00 01     -> height = 1
- 80        -> pixel data (1000 0000 = first pixel on, 7 padding bits)

Total File Size
- 7 + ceil((width * height) / 8) bytes
