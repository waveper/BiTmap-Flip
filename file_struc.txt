File Structure

Example here in Hex:

42 52 46 00 01 00 01 80

42 54 46 (a Hex signature convert into "BTF", if its not there, the custom image viewer will result an Error) first 3 bytes
00 01 (width) 2 bytes
00 01 (height) also 2 bytes
80 (1 pixel, convert to string binary 10000000) (width * height) bytes
